DIFFICULTY: ${config.label}

TASK:
Generate exactly ${count} interview questions with this distribution:

- ${behavioralCount} behavioral questions (STAR format, leadership, teamwork, conflict resolution)
- ${systemDesignCount} system design questions (architecture, scalability, trade-offs)

2. Each question must follow the schema below exactly
3. orderIndex starts at 0 and increments by 1
4. Technical questions must be specific to ${jobRole} responsibilities
5. Behavioral questions MUST start with "Tell me about a time..." or "Describe a situation..."
6. System design questions MUST mention scale (users, requests per second, or data volume)
7. Do NOT number the questions inside the text field
8. Questions must reflect ${company}'s actual interview culture
